+ **[Pregel](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1807167.1807184?casa_token=PG6tuF58wGAAAAAA:mTvObkCQMluhRYly0oaHpQflRU6j4KpwWxCz-9xMAlJ6D5OvUZ6A7bl_6v0tZBPU7jPWTQ1hXHNW):**
  Framework developed at Google that introduced the think like a vertex model and employs a [BSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_synchronous_parallel) communication.
+ **[Apache Giraph](https://giraph.apache.org/):** Giraph is the open-source implementation of Pregel. Communication is facilitated via Apache Hadoop map/reduce operations.
